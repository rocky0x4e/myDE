# urgent: The window will always be marked urgent, but the focus will not be stolen.
# focus: The window will always be focused and not be marked urgent.
# none: The window will neither be focused, nor be marked urgent.

# WINDOW RULES:
################################################################################################
# all: Matches all windows. This criterion requires no value.
# class: Compares the window class (the second part of WM_CLASS). Use the special value __focused__ to match all windows having the same window class as the currently focused window.
# instance: Compares the window instance (the first part of WM_CLASS). Use the special value __focused__ to match all windows having the same window instance as the currently focused window.
# window_role: Compares the window role (WM_WINDOW_ROLE). Use the special value __focused__ to match all windows having the same window role as the currently focused window.
# window_type: Compare the window type (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE). Possible values are normal, dialog, utility, toolbar, splash, menu, dropdown_menu, popup_menu, tooltip and notification.
# machine: Compares the name of the machine the client window is running on (WM_CLIENT_MACHINE). Usually, it is equal to the hostname of the local machine, but it may differ if remote X11 apps are used.
# id: Compares the X11 window ID, which you can get via xwininfo for example.
# title: Compares the X11 window title (_NET_WM_NAME or WM_NAME as fallback). Use the special value __focused__ to match all windows having the same window title as the currently focused window.
# urgent: Compares the urgent state of the window. Can be "latest" or "oldest". Matches the latest or oldest urgent window, respectively. (The following aliases are also available: newest, last, recent, first)
# workspace: Compares the workspace name of the workspace the window belongs to. Use the special value __focused__ to match all windows in the currently focused workspace.
# con_mark: Compares the marks set for this container, see [vim_like_marks]. A match is made if any of the containerâ€™s marks matches the specified mark.
# con_id; Compares the i3-internal container ID, which you can get via the IPC interface. Handy for scripting. Use the special value __focused__ to match only the currently focused window.
# floating: Only matches floating windows. This criterion requires no value.
# floating_from: Like floating but this criterion takes two possible values: "auto" and "user". With "auto", only windows that were automatically opened as floating are matched. With "user", only windows that the user made floating are matched.
# tiling: Only matches tiling windows. This criterion requires no value.
# tiling_from: Like tiling but this criterion takes two possible values: "auto" and "user". With "auto", only windows that were automatically opened as tiling are matched. With "user", only windows that the user made tiling are matched.
# The criteria class, instance, role, title, workspace, machine and mark are actually regular expressions (PCRE). See pcresyntax(3) or perldoc perlre for information on how to use them.
